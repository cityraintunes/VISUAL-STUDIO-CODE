    <h1>My Journey Learning Code</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center><p>My <i>Journey</i> learning code started out as a simple one. I decided that I was stuck
        in my career and no longer wanted to be at the whim of industry wind. Were I to stay in my current field
        I would be capped out at a certain salary. Given that I am going to be a dad, I want to maximize my income
        for my family. I want to make as much money as I can so that I can provide for my family.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        It is <b>essential</b> to me to provide for my family. To be the best dad I can. I also know that I am smart and can learn things.
        I no longer have the passion for music like I used to. I want to transfer that passion into something like coding. Which is something
        I can do long term to increase both my brain power and earnings potential.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
       I want to learn how to code <b>primarily</b> so I can replace the habit of playing video games with the habit of coding. I will get the same sense
       of satisfaction at completing a code, or learning a new trick, as I would with beating a boss. I won't entirely stop playing games, as I still enjoy playing them,
       but coding should provide me with real world skills that could help me advance in my career. This makes me happy and feel good.
